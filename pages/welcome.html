        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        Howdy! My name is Brandon Hollowell and I'm a Software Engineer currently based out of North Dallas. I graduated 
        with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin in May 2017 and have been
        working in the Voice Over IP space ever since. Currently I build custom server/appliance monitoring and reporting solutions for 
        an enterprise contact center environment.
        <br /><br />
        I've been programming since I was in 8th grade (2008) and have been a fullstack developer ever since. I'm a big 
        supporter of Open Source Software and my 2019 New Year's Resolution is to move as much of my life as possible 
        over to GNU/Linux.
        <br /><br />
        Feel free to poke around and check out some of my projects which can be found on the projects page over in the 
        sidebar. If you would like to contact me please send me an email (again, sidebar) and I'll get back to you as soon 
        as possible!
